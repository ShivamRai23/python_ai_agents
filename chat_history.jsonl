Introduction**\n\n1.1 Purpose\n\nThis document specifies the requirements for Siren, a mobile chat application similar to WhatsApp.  Siren will allow users to send text messages, images, and videos, and make voice and video calls.\n\n1.2 Scope\n\nSiren will be a cross-platform application available on iOS and Android.  It will support individual and group chats, end-to-end encryption, and user profile management.  Future phases may include features such as status updates, stories, and business integrations.\n\n1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations\n\n* **SRS:** Software Requirements Specification\n* **UI:** User Interface\n* **API:** Application Programming Interface\n* **E2E:** End-to-End\n\n**2. Overall Description**\n\n2.1 Product Perspective\n\nSiren is a client-server application.  The client applications (iOS and Android) will interact with a central server to facilitate communication between users.\n\n2.2 Product Functions\n\n* **User Registration and Login:** Users can create accounts using email addresses or phone numbers.\n* **Contact Management:** Users can add, remove, and manage their contact lists.\n* **Individual and Group Chats:** Users can communicate with individuals or create groups for multi-person conversations.\n* **Message Sending and Receiving:** Users can send and receive text messages, images, videos, and voice notes.\n* **Voice and Video Calls:** Users can make voice and video calls to individuals or groups.\n* **File Sharing:** Users can share various file types (images, videos, documents).\n* **End-to-End Encryption:** All communication will be secured using end-to-end encryption.\n* **User Profile Management:** Users can manage their profile information (profile picture, name, status).\n* **Notification System:** Users receive notifications for new messages and calls.\n* **Offline Messaging:** Messages are stored on the server and delivered when the recipient is online.\n\n2.3 User Characteristics\n\nSiren will be used by individuals of varying technical skills.  The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate.\n\n2.4 Operating Environment\n\n* **Client:** iOS 14+, Android 8+\n* **Server:** Cloud-based server infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure - to be determined)\n\n2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints\n\n* The application must comply with all relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n* The application should be scalable to handle a large number of users.\n* The application should be secure and protect user data.\n\n2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies\n\n* A robust and scalable server infrastructure will be provided.\n* Third-party libraries for encryption and media handling will be used.\n\n\n**3. Specific Requirements**\n\n**(This section will be significantly expanded.  The following are examples;  you'll need to add many more detailed requirements for each feature.)**\n\n3.1 External Interface Requirements\n\n* **User Interfaces:**  Intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for both iOS and Android.\n* **Hardware Interfaces:**  Access to camera, microphone, and storage.\n* **Software Interfaces:**  Integration with push notification services (Firebase, etc.).\n* **Communication Interfaces:**  Secure communication protocols (e.g., WebSockets).\n\n3.2 Functional Requirements\n\n* **FR1 - User Registration:**  The system shall allow users to register using a valid email or phone number.\n* **FR2 - Message Sending:** The system shall allow users to send text messages up to a specified character limit.\n* **FR3 - Group Chat Creation:** The system shall allow users to create groups and add participants.\n* **FR4 - End-to-End Encryption:** All communication shall be protected by end-to-end encryption.\n* **FR5 - File Sharing:** Users shall be able to share images, videos, and documents up to a specified size limit.\n\n\n3.3 Non-Functional Requirements\n\n* **Performance Requirements:**  The application should respond quickly to user actions.\n* **Security Requirements:**  The application must protect user data from unauthorized access.\n* **Usability Requirements:**  The application should be easy to learn and use.\n* **Reliability Requirements:**  The application should be reliable and available.\n* **Scalability Requirements:**  The application should be able to scale to handle a large number of users.\n\n\n**4. Future Considerations**\n\n* Integration with social media platforms\n* Status updates and stories\n* Voice and video call recording\n* Location sharing\n\n\nThis is a skeletal SRS.  You need to significantly expand Section 3 with detailed requirements covering all aspects of the application's functionality, including error handling, input validation, and specific UI elements.  Consider using a table format to clearly define each requirement with its ID, description, priority, and other relevant attributes. Remember to also add detailed acceptance criteria for each requirement.\n"}

Third-party libraries for encryption and media handling will be used.\n\n\n3. **Specific Requirements**\n\n**(This section will be significantly expanded. The following are examples; you'll need to add many more detailed requirements for each feature.)**\n\n3.1 External Interface Requirements\n\n    1. User Interfaces: Intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for both iOS and Android.\n    2. Hardware Interfaces: Access to camera, microphone, and storage.\n    3. Software Interfaces: Integration with push notification services (Firebase, etc.).\n    4. Communication Interfaces: Secure communication protocols (e.g., WebSockets).\n\n3.2 Functional Requirements\n\n    1. FR1 - User Registration: The system shall allow users to register using a valid email or phone number.\n    2. FR2 - Message Sending: The system shall allow users to send text messages up to a specified character limit.\n    3. FR3 - Group Chat Creation: The system shall allow users to create groups and add participants.\n    4. FR4 - End-to-End Encryption: All communication shall be protected by end-to-end encryption.\n    5. FR5 - File Sharing: Users shall be able to share images, videos, and documents up to a specified size limit.\n\n\n3.3 Non-Functional Requirements\n\n    1. Performance Requirements: The application should respond quickly to user actions.\n    2. Security Requirements: The application must protect user data from unauthorized access.\n    3. Usability Requirements: The application should be easy to learn and use.\n    4. Reliability Requirements: The application should be reliable and available.\n    5. Scalability Requirements: The application should be able to scale to handle a large number of users.\n\n\n4. **Future Considerations**\n\n    1. Integration with social media platforms\n    2. Status updates and stories\n    3. Voice and video call recording\n    4. Location sharing\n\n\nThis is a skeletal SRS. You need to significantly expand Section 3 with detailed requirements covering all aspects of the application's functionality, including error handling, input validation, and specific UI elements. Consider using a table format to clearly define each requirement with its ID, description, priority, and other relevant attributes. Remember to also add detailed acceptance criteria for each requirement.\n\nI've improved the numbering and removed the asterisks as requested.  Remember that this is still a very high-level outline and needs considerable expansion to be a complete and useful SRS.\n"}
